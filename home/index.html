        We are students of the Cisco Networking Academy at the Chesterfield Career and Technical Center!
        In this program, we have the opportunity to learn the principles and strategies used to build, secure, and maintain computer networks. In other words, we'll soon be the reason your internet works and lets you connect to your favorite online games and services.<br><br>
        Every year the Cisco Networking Academy students are challenged to host our own gaming tournament. This allows us to put our skills to the test by creating and maintaining a network for all of the players to connect to. We also gain experience by organizing the event itself, with each student playing a role in the management of the tournament. <br><br>
        The event is a major learning experience for us, and it also helps raise funds for our entire program.
        If you are interested in becoming a part of the Cisco Networking Academy, see the information below!<br><br>
